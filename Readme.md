# ConsoleTables

Have you ever just wanted to output flat structured POCO out to console? Sure you have! This class will let you print a nicely formatted table right to your console as easily as possible.

## Example usage
```csharp
// using ConsoleTables;
static void Main(String[] args)
{
    var table = new ConsoleTable("one", "two", "three");
    table.AddRow(1, 2, 3)
         .AddRow("this line should be longer", "yes it is", "oh");

    table.Write();
    Console.WriteLine();

    var rows = Enumerable.Repeat(new Something(), 10);

    ConsoleTable
        .From<Something>(rows)
        .Configure(o => o.NumberAlignment = Alignment.Right)
        .Write(Format.Alternative);

    Console.ReadKey();
}
```

## Console output
